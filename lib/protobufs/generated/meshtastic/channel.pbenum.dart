///  How this channel is being used (or not).
///  Note: this field is an enum to give us options for the future.
///  In particular, someday we might make a 'SCANNING' option.
///  SCANNING channels could have different frequencies and the radio would
///  occasionally check that freq to see if anything is being transmitted.
///  For devices that have multiple physical radios attached, we could keep multiple PRIMARY/SCANNING channels active at once to allow
///  cross band routing as needed.
///  If a device has only a single radio (the common case) only one channel can be PRIMARY at a time
///  (but any number of SECONDARY channels can't be sent received on that common frequency)
